# Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer `num`, return  *three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) **that** sum **to* `num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return *an** empty** array.* 

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= num <= 1015

class Solution {
    public long[] sumOfThree(long num) {    
        if(num%3!=0){
        return new long[0];

    }
    num=num/3;
    return new long[]{num-1,num,num+1};
        
    }
}
```
