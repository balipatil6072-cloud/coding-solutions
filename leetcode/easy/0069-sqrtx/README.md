# Sqrt(x)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return  *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be  **non-negative**  as well.

You  **must not use**  any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x <= 1)
            return x;

        for (int i = 1; i <=x / 2; i++) {
            if (i * i > x)
                return i - 1;

        }
        return x / 2;
    }

}
```
