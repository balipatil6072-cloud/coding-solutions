# Valid Perfect Square

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a positive integer num, return `true`  *if*  `num`  *is a perfect square or*  `false`  *otherwise*.

A  **perfect square**  is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= num <= 231 - 1

       int high=num;
       int ans;
       while(low<=high){
        int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
        long sq=mid*mid;
        if(sq==num) return true;
        else if(mid*mid>num) high=mid-1;
        else low=mid+1;
       
       }
        return false;
    }
}
```
